## Using the Official GoCoin WooCommerce Plugin
When a shopper chooses the GoCoin payment method and places their order, they will be redirected to gateway.GoCoin.com to pay.  
GoCoin will send a notification to your server which this plugin handles.  Then the customer will be redirected to n order summary page.  

The order status in the admin panel will be "on-hold" when the order is placed and "processing" if payment has been confirmed. 

#### Important Note:
